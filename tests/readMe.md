# Tests

## Overview

The `tests` directory is intended to house the test suite for the SproutPy Framework. This folder will contain unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the framework as it develops.

## Aim

The primary aim of this folder is to organize and maintain tests that will:

- Verify the correctness of individual components (unit tests).
- Ensure that different components work together as expected (integration tests).
- Simulate real-world usage scenarios to validate the overall functionality of the application (end-to-end tests).

## Future Structure

As the test suite is developed, the `tests` directory will be structured as follows:

- **Unit Tests**: Contained in the `unit/` directory. These tests will focus on individual modules and functions.
- **Integration Tests**: Contained in the `integration/` directory. These tests will focus on the interaction between multiple components.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Contained in the `e2e/` directory. These tests will simulate user interactions and full application workflows.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, the following command will be used:

```bash
python -m unittest sproutpy tests
```

This command will automatically discover and run all the test files in the `tests` directory.

## Writing Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests will be written to verify the functionality of individual components. Each unit test file will be placed in the `unit/` directory and will follow this general structure:

```python
import unittest
from app.http.controllers.AuthController import AuthController

class TestAuthController(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.controller = AuthController()

    def test_login(self):
        request = {}  # Mock request data
        response = self.controller.login(request)
        self.assertIn('status', response)
        self.assertEqual(response['status'], 'success')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests will be written to ensure that different components of the framework interact correctly. Each integration test file will be placed in the `integration/` directory.

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests will be written to simulate user interactions with the application and validate end-to-end workflows. Each end-to-end test file will be placed in the `e2e/` directory.

## Conclusion

The `tests` directory is a crucial part of the SproutPy Framework, aimed at ensuring the quality and reliability of the project. As the framework evolves, this folder will be populated with comprehensive tests that will help maintain and improve the overall codebase.
