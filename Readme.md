## SproutPy: Python Framework for Streamlined Development

SproutPy is a Python framework designed to accelerate your web application development by providing a structured template architecture. It offers a foundation for building well-organized and maintainable projects, allowing you to focus on the core functionalities of your application.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Python (version 3.x recommended)
* A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

**Installation (Coming Soon!)**

There are two ways to get started with SproutPy:

1. **Install from PyPI (Future Release):**
   * Once SproutPy is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI), you can install it using pip:
     Bash

     ```
     pip install sproutpy
     ```
2. **Clone the Repository (Current Development):**
   * If you want to contribute to the development of SproutPy or use the latest features, you can clone the Git repository:

     ```

**Basic Project Structure**

SproutPy provides a pre-defined directory structure to organize your project effectively. Here's a general outline:

* **app** : This directory contains the core application logic, including controllers, models, middlewares, utilities and services
* **config** : This folder stores configuration settings for your application; mail,config,database, others
* **requirements.txt** : This file lists the external dependencies required by your project.
* **resources**: This folder contains static file views, houses auth, resources and other
* **routes**: Routes folder houses all routes to be used in the application.
* **public**: This folder houses public assets for the application.
* **tests** : This directory is dedicated to writing unit tests for your application code.

**Documentation (Coming Soon!)**

Comprehensive documentation for SproutPy, including detailed explanations of components, usage guides, and best practices, will be available soon.
